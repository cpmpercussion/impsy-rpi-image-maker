# impsy-rpi-image-maker

Creates Raspberry Pi OS images for running [IMPSY](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/imps).

This repo just contains Ansible playbooks for constructing an image. The process uses [pi-ci](https://github.com/ptrsr/pi-ci/) an emulated Raspberry Pi environment.

The playbooks originated with [pi-ci](https://github.com/ptrsr/pi-ci/)'s examples.

Most likely, the latest IMPSY image will be available as a release from this repo. It should be compatible with Raspberry Pis 3, 4, 5 and Zero 2 W.
